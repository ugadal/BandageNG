        "  * Largest edge overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph. For most graphs this will be the same as the smallest edge overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n"
        "  * Total length: The total number of base pairs in the graph.\n"
        "  * Total length no overlaps: The total number of base pairs in the graph, subtracting bases that are duplicated in edge overlaps.\n"
        "  * Dead ends: The number of instances where an end of a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n"
        "  * Percentage dead ends: The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number of dead ends is twice the number of nodes (occurs when there are no edges), so this value is the number of dead ends divided by twice the node count.\n"
        "  * Connected components: The number of regions of the graph which are disconnected from each other.\n"
        "  * Largest component: The total number of base pairs in the largest connected component.\n"
        "  * Total length orphaned nodes: The total number of base pairs in orphan nodes (nodes with no edges).\n"
        "  * N50: Nodes that are this length or greater will collectively add up to at least half of the total length.\n"
        "  * Shortest node: The length of the shortest node in the graph.\n"
        "  * Lower quartile node: The median node length for the shorter half of the nodes.\n"
        "  * Median node: The median node length for the graph.\n"
        "  * Upper quartile node: The median node length for the longer half of the nodes.\n"
        "  * Longest node: The length of the longest node in the graph.\n"
        "  * Median depth: The median depth of the graph, by base.\n"
        "  * Estimated sequence length: An estimate of the total number of bases in the original sequence, calculated by multiplying each node's length (minus overlaps) by its depth relative to the median.");
